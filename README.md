## Project Topic: Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This project focuses on applying data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from raw data. By collecting, cleaning, and analyzing datasets, the project aims to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can support data-driven decision-making. Using tools such as Python, Excel, or SQL along with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the analysis will include both descriptive and inferential statistics. The outcome will be a clear, visual presentation of findings that can help stakeholders make strategic choices based on evidence rather than intuition.
