# DSA-Documentation
This is where i started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the IncubatorHub.

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolio Buliding

## Project Topic: Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This project focuses on applying data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from raw data. By collecting, cleaning, and analyzing datasets, the project aims to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can support data-driven decision-making. Using tools such as Python, Excel, or SQL along with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the analysis will include both descriptive and inferential statistics. The outcome will be a clear, visual presentation of findings that can help stakeholders make strategic choices based on evidence rather than intuition.

### Data Sources
The primary data source for this project will be survey-based data collection using tools such as Google Forms or SurveyMonkey. This allows for the collection of first-hand, specific, and relevant information directly from respondents based on the project's objectives. The survey will be designed to gather quantitative and qualitative data on key variables of interest, such as user behavior, preferences, satisfaction, or performance metrics.

This approach ensures: High relevance to the research questions, Control over data structure and quality, Up-to-date and specific insights based on the current environment.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
   - For data entry, cleaning, basic analysis, and visualization.
- Python
   - With libraries like:
- Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy – Numerical computing
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
    – Data visualization
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
    - To query and manage structured data in relational databases.
- Power BI / Tableau
   - For interactive dashboards and visual representation of insights.
- Jupyter Notebook
   - For writing and running Python code in an interactive format, combining code, visuals, and narrative.

``` SQL
SELECT A,B,C
WHERE A> 45
```
